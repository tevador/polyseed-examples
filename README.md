This repository contains language bindings and examples how to use the [polyseed](https://github.com/tevador/polyseed) library in C, C++ and C#.

All of the code examples require the library to be built and installed on the local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/tevador/polyseed.git
cd polyseed
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
